### Usage Notes
- This layout is suitable for full-page designs with a fixed navbar.
- The `Navbar` component is styled with padding for better spacing.
- You can customize the `Content` area by adjusting the `min-height` style.

### Alerts
> ⚠️ Ensure that the `Main` component wraps both `Navbar` and `Content` for proper layout behavior.
