# Introduction

Welcome to the **Arniva API Client**, a lightweight and powerful HTTP client designed for seamless API communication. Originally built for the **Arniva team**, this client is optimized for **SvelteKit** but remains fully usable in other JavaScript and TypeScript environments.

> **⚠️ Important:** This client uses the **native `fetch` API**, not SvelteKit's enhanced `fetch`. Make sure to handle requests accordingly when using it in a SvelteKit project.

## Why Use This API Client?
This API client provides a clean and efficient way to interact with APIs, offering:

- **Simple Interface** – Straightforward methods for all HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`).
- **Interceptors** – Modify requests and responses globally.
- **Robust Error Handling** – Detailed error objects with type information.
- **Request Cancellation** – Abort in-flight requests when needed.
- **Automatic Retry** – Configure retry attempts for failed requests.
- **Response Transformation** – Extract specific data from API responses.
- **File Uploads** – Easy file upload handling.
- **TypeScript Support** – Full type definitions for a better developer experience.

These features will be covered in detail in later sections.
