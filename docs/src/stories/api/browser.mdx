# Browser Compatibility

The Arniva API Client is built on modern web standards while maintaining broad compatibility with different browsers and environments.

## Core Technology

This library uses the native [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) as its foundation, providing a modern approach to making HTTP requests with excellent performance characteristics.

## Browser Support

### Modern Browsers

The API client works out-of-the-box with all modern browsers, including:


<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
        <th>Browser</th>
        <th>Supported Versions</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>Chrome</td>
        <td>42+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Firefox</td>
        <td>39+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Safari</td>
        <td>10.1+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Edge</td>
        <td>14+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Opera</td>
        <td>29+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Chrome for Android</td>
        <td>93+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Safari on iOS</td>
        <td>10.3+</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Legacy Browser Support

For older browsers that don't support the Fetch API natively, you'll need to include a polyfill. We recommend one of the following:

- [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch) - A lightweight polyfill focused only on the Fetch API
- [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) - A polyfill that works in both browser and Node.js environments

```javascript
// To use with a polyfill in older browsers, simply include it before your code:
import 'whatwg-fetch';
import { ApiClient } from '@ruzgardogu/api';

const api = new ApiClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com'
});
```

## Node.js Compatibility

While primarily designed for browser environments, the API client can also be used in Node.js applications with the appropriate fetch polyfill:

```javascript
// For Node.js prior to v18
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import { AbortController } from 'abort-controller';

// Make fetch and AbortController available globally
globalThis.fetch = fetch;
globalThis.AbortController = AbortController;

import { ApiClient } from '@ruzgardogu/api';
```

> **Note**: Node.js v18+ includes native fetch support, so no polyfill is required.

## Feature Detection

The API client performs feature detection for advanced capabilities like AbortController (for request cancellation) and automatically provides fallbacks when needed.

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Limits
Most browsers limit the number of concurrent connections to the same domain (typically 6-8). For applications making many simultaneous requests, consider:

- Using request batching with the ```api.all()``` method
- Implementing request queuing for non-critical requests
- Using multiple subdomains for API endpoints to bypass connection limits

## Common Issues and Solutions

### CORS Restrictions
The API client respects browser security policies. If you encounter CORS-related errors, ensure your server is correctly configured to allow cross-origin requests.

### Mixed Content Warnings
When using the API client on an HTTPS site to make requests to HTTP endpoints, browsers will block these requests as mixed content. Ensure all your API endpoints use HTTPS.

### Local File Access
Due to browser security restrictions, the Fetch API cannot access local files (file://) directly. For local development with local files, consider using a development server.

### Testing
We recommend testing your API integration across multiple browsers, especially if you're supporting older browsers. The API client is regularly tested against the current and previous versions of major browsers.
