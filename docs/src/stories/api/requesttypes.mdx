## Request Types

The API client supports all common HTTP request types with a simple and consistent interface.

### GET
Fetch data from an API endpoint.
```ts
const response = await apiClient.get('/users');
```

### POST
Send data to an API endpoint.
```ts
const response = await apiClient.post('/users', { name: 'John Doe' });
```

### PUT
Update an existing resource.
```ts
const response = await apiClient.put('/users/1', { name: 'John Updated' });
```

### PATCH
Partially update an existing resource.
```ts
const response = await apiClient.patch('/users/1', { age: 30 });
```

### DELETE
Remove a resource from the API.
```ts
const response = await apiClient.delete('/users/1');
```

These methods provide a clean and intuitive way to interact with APIs. ðŸš€
